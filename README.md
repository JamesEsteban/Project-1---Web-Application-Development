# **Burger Boss** - Milestone Project

## **Introduction** ##

Welcome to my milestone project - Burger Boss, a fictional burger restaurant website which displays products and services that could be offered to customers. 

After spending the past 18 months teaching myself to code, I chose to enrol in the level 5 Web Application Development course, to expand my knowledge and fill any gaps that naturally come with unstructured self study. My first milestone project was created using mainly HTML and CSS, I have managed to build a funtional static website to display information on a fictional restaurant. 

In this document, I will explain my motivations behind the project, as well breaking down exactly how I got to this point. I will discuss the steps that I took to complete the project and go into detail about the processes that were followed along the way. 

Thank you for taking the time to view my project.

## **UX – User Experience** ##

When building this project, I took UX into account as it is an incredibly important aspect of any website. Creating a meaningful and satisfying interation for the user was one of my main goals and I wanted to make the site intuitive and easy to navigate. 

UX design is broken dfown into five planes, each of which I considered and added into my design and development process. These five planes are: 

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## **The Strategy Plane** ##

I wanted to challenge myself with this project, I orginally began building a portfolio website but I had previously created a similar site, which felt a little bit stale and too safe. I wanted to try something new and test my skills and creativity by attacking the project from a different angle. I decided to use https://goodbrief.io to randomly select my project for me. I did this to push myself out of my comfort zone and to create a project that I usually wouldn't be inclined to work towards.

The target audience for burger boss are people aged 18-30 with a love for food (especially street food). When creating the site I wanted to provide:
    *Clear and easy to find information
    *A diverse range of photos to showcase potential products
    *Contact Information/ a contact form
    *Different sections for different product types
    *An easy to navigate menu and responsive design

This website provides all of the above and includes a bold and striking colour pallette, the intention was to create a fun and excitng looking inteface that isn't overloaded with information.

The inspiration for the website came from local burger restautants and street food venders such as https://burgerboi.co.uk/, https://digbethdiningclub.com/ and https://www.libertineburger.com/

### **The Scope Plane** ###

To achieve the goals set out above, the site will includethe following: 

    - A header and menu bar with links to sections on a continuous home page
    - Menu bar links to secondary pages to view menus for different product types
    - Product information for a range of different products
    - A contact form where potential customers can book a table and ask any questions they might have
    - Location and contact information
    - Links to social media pages

 ### **The Structure PLane** ###   

 The website will include a home page with a full screen header image and H1 text, introducting the site to the user. The home page will include various sections including an "about" section, a mid page navigation section to point the user towards different product pages, a menu section and a contact form. 

### ***Colours*** ### 
 The home page will have a dark background with neon pink text to create a bold and eye catching design, with images, lighter sections and icons to break up the page. 

 The prouduct pages will contain the same colour scheme and will include images and text on cards to display each product. 

### ***Typograophy*** ### 

 -Habanero
 -Open Sans

 I selected Habenero as it's quite a striking font - I wanted to create a fun and engaging interface that draws the attention of the user. This font has been used for all headings and titles to show a bold break between sections. 

 I opted for the open sans font for the informative sections as it's easy to read and highlights where the user can find important information - this font contrasts with the boldness of the font used for the headings but they complement eachother well, showing the intent of each section. 

 Text will be consistent throughout the site - Headings are centered and appear above each section and will be written in uppercase. 


### **The Skeleton Plane** ###


### **The Surface Plane** ###

**Features present throughout the website**

- Navbar – Responsive, toggles to a hamburger menu at a width of 991 pixels for both tablet and mobile devices. Coloured black for inactive pages and colored pink for the currently active page. 
The main logo on the left acts also as a link back to the home page.
- Footer – INcludes another logo to make suire branding is present throughout the site. The footer also includes information on location and opening times. 
- A large hero image at at the top of each page. The home page hero image takes up the full view height of the device, giving a bright, sleek and welcoming feel top the home page. The inner pages all contain a slightly smaller hero image with a relevant photo displayed. 
The hero image on the landing page has a darker overlay to help the text stand out better. Text also includes a pink shadow to help it stand out against the background. 
- Dark background for users to feel less tired while reading, the pink text also stands out against this and makes the site more memorable than plain black and white configurations.
- Chosen fonts cath the users attention and makes the site feel less forgettable than other, more traditional fonts.

### **Testing** ###

The Burger Boss website was tested on ther following browsers: 

    -Google Chrome
    -Mozilla Firefox
    -Microsoft Edge
    -Safari 

The site was successful and responsive on all browsers. 

I also manually tested the site on an iPhone 11, iPhone X, 14 inch laptop and a 24 inch desktop monitor. 
Throughout the project, I leveraged the Google Dev Tools to test responsiveness. Chrome Developer Tools were used to emulate the following devices: 
    - iPhone SE
    - iPhone 12 Pro
    - Pixel 5
    - Samsung Galaxy S8+
    - iPad Air 
    - iPad Mini 
    - Galaxy Fold


The  W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator was used on the CSS sheet to validate the code throughout the project. No errors were found. - [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
